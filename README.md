## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
* [Helm](https://helm.sh) - v3 is actually quite amazing and coming from Ansible, the templating is somewhat easy to pick up
* [Tekton](https://tekton.dev) - An amazing pipeline/workflow platform. The logic of the objects is very "Ansible like" and makes it easy to pick up. This is the upstream project for [OpenShift Pipelines](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/ci-cd) from Red Hat
* [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) - These have been on my radar for a while now, but a use-case finally came about on a project I work on to dig deeper into this
 
## üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
* Anything in the OpenShift/Kubernetes space and supporting envrionments
* Most tooling in the DevOps world.
 
## ‚ö° Fun fact ...
* I have a brand of shoes named after me, but not really. There is a pro skateboarder named Kyle Walker who has his own line of shoes from [Vans](https://www.vans.com/shop/skate-shoes#facet=ads_f40501_ntk_cs%253A%2522Kyle%2BWalker%2522&beginIndex=0). Its always fun to show people "my" shoes :D

## ‚≠êÔ∏è Completed Projects ...
* [ansible-for-openshift](https://github.com/KyWa/ansible-for-openshift) - Using Ansible to Deploy an OpenShift 4.X cluster
