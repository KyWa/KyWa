:construction: As with most things (and the late, but great GeoCities), this is a work in progress. :construction: 

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
* [ansible-for-openshift](https://github.com/KyWa/ansible-for-openshift) - Using Ansible to Deploy an OpenShift 4.X cluster
* [mineOps](https://github.com/KyWa/mineOps) - Teaching DevOps tooling with Minecraft Server

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
* Helm - v3 is actually quite amazing and coming from Ansible, the templating is super easy to pick up
 
## ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
* Anything in the OpenShift/Kubernetes space and supporting envrionments
* Most tooling in the DevOps world.
* Enabling GPUs in a secure way for containerized workloads
 
## âš¡ Fun fact: ...
* I have a brand of shoes named after me, but not really. There is a pro Skater named Kyle Walker who has his own line of shoes from Vans. Its always fun to show people "my" shoes :D
