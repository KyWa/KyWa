* Most tooling in the DevOps world
* Guiding people on the awesomeness that is k8s
 
## ⚡ Fun facts and Hobbies ...
* I have a brand of shoes named after me, but not really. There is a pro skateboarder named Kyle Walker who has his own line of shoes from [Vans](https://www.vans.com/en-us/p/shoes/black-7001/kyle-walker-shoe-VN0A5JIEY28). Its always fun to show people "my" shoes :D
* Huge fan of Warhammer in most forms and love painting models. Nothing worth posting pictures of, but always happy to discuss anything in that hobby :)
